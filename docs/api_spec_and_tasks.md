## Logic Analysis
```python
[
    ("main.py", "Contains the main entry point of the game. It creates the game and starts it."),
    ("game.py", "Contains the Game class that handles the game logic. It creates the Snake and Food objects, controls the game speed and updates the score."),
    ("snake.py", "Contains the Snake class that represents the snake. It handles the movement and growth of the snake and the change of direction."),
    ("food.py", "Contains the Food class that represents the food items. It handles the generation of food items."),
    ("test_game.py", "Contains the unit tests for the Game class."),
    ("test_snake.py", "Contains the unit tests for the Snake class."),
    ("test_food.py", "Contains the unit tests for the Food class.")
]
```

## Task list
```python
[
    "main.py",
    "game.py",
    "snake.py",
    "food.py",
    "test_game.py",
    "test_snake.py",

## Shared Knowledge
```python
"""
'curses' is a library that provides functions for creating text-based user interfaces.
'argparse' is a library for parsing command-line options and arguments.
'unittest' is a library for creating and running tests.
The 'Snake' class represents the snake in the game. It has a 'body' attribute that is a list of tuples representing the positions of the snake's body segments, and a 'direction' attribute that is a string representing the direction the snake is moving in.
The 'Food' class represents the food items in the game. It has a 'position' attribute that is a tuple representing the position of the food item.
The 'Game' class controls the game logic. It has a 'score' attribute that is an integer representing the player's score, a 'speed' attribute that is an integer representing the game speed, a 'snake' attribute that is a Snake object, and a 'food' attribute that is a Food object.

## Anything UNCLEAR
There is no unclear point in the provided context. The implementation approach, data structures, program call flow, and file list are all clear. However, we need to ensure that all team members are familiar with the Python libraries 'curses', 'argparse', and 'unittest'.
