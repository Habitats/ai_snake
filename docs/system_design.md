## Implementation approach
To implement this CLI Snake game, we will use Python's built-in libraries such as `curses` for the UI and `threading` for handling game speed and user input simultaneously. The game will be structured around a main `Game` class that will handle the game logic, a `Snake` class that will represent the snake, and a `Food` class for the food items. We will also use `unittest` for testing our game logic and `argparse` for handling command line arguments.

## Python package name
```python
"cli_snake_game"
```

## File list
```python
[
    "main.py",
    "game.py",
    "snake.py",
    "food.py",
    "test_game.py",
    "test_snake.py",
    "test_food.py"
]
```

## Data structures and interface definitions
```mermaid

    class Game{
        +int score
        +int speed
        +Snake snake
        +Food food
        +start_game()
        +end_game()
        +increase_speed()
        +decrease_speed()
        +update_score()
    }
    class Snake{
        +list body
        +str direction
        +move()
        +grow()
        +change_direction(str: direction)
    }
    class Food{
        +tuple position
        +generate()
    }
    Game "1" -- "1" Snake: has
    Game "1" -- "1" Food: has
```

## Program call flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant M as Main
    participant G as Game
    participant S as Snake
    participant F as Food
    M->>G: create game
    G->>S: create snake
    G->>F: create food
    M->>G: start game
    G->>S: move snake
    G->>F: generate food
    G->>G: update score
    G->>G: increase speed
    G->>G: decrease speed
    G->>M: end game
```

## Anything UNCLEAR
The requirement is clear to me.
